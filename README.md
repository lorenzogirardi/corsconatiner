A CORS proxy in a container (Docker) for when you need to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`!

You can use CORS Container without running it yourself via Heroku (it's on a free tier dyno, so initial startup time may be slow!) [https://cors-container.herokuapp.com](https://cors-container.herokuapp.com).

## About

If you need permissive CORS for a front-end project, simply deploy this container and proxy your HTTP requests through it.

Once the container is running, you may navigate to [http://container-address:3000/https://jacobclark.xyz](http://container-address:3000/https://jacobclark.xyz), `cors-container` will then proxy the specified resource and transform the original headers to be CORS permissive, whilst keeping origional headers in-tact.

If you intend to use this in production over the open web, ensure the service is locked down with restrictive firewall/access permissions, otherwise any content may be proxied over your server.

I suggest implementing proper CORS headers on your resources and using this for development purposes only.

## Relative URL rewriting 

cors-container can rewrite relative URLs to full URLs of the response body you have proxied. 

For example if we wish to proxy `http://blog.jacobclark.xyz/` and cors-container is runinnng on `http://localhost:3000/` the request URL would be `http://localhost:3000/http://blog.jacobclark.xyz/`.

cors-container will rewrite any relative URLs it finds in the proxies response body. For example `<a href="/css/style.css">` would be modified to `<a href="http://localhost:3000/http://blog.jacobclark.xyz/css/style.css">` in the proxied response.

This can be useful if you wish to be able to pull additional assets on a page through the proxy such as stylesheets and JavaScript. 

This is not enabled by default as this option mutates the original response body. 

Set `rewrite-urls` in the request header to cors-cotainer if you want relative URLs rewriting.
